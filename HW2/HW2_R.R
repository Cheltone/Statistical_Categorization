###Number 4, 2.18
'
a) To calculate the expected frequency of 35.8, sum the first row (290), then sum the
first column (168), and then sum all (1362)

Finally,

(290*168)/1362 = 35.77

b) The degrees of freedom are equal to (3-1)*(3-1)=4'''

The P-Value is very small or ~ 0. This extremely low P-Value suggests that happiness and income are related.

c) Both of the standarized residuals in the cells in question suggest strong evidence that there are fewer than the hypothesis predicted.

###Number 4, 2.21
a) The X2 test is not appropriate to use in the situation because the subjects (men or women) choices are not independent.
In essence, each gender could choose as many as they wish (and it looks like they did).

###Number 5, 2.27
A study on educational aspirations of high school students (S. Crysdale, Int. J.
Comp. Sociol., 16: 19-36, 1975) measured aspirations using the scale (some
high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate). For students
whose family income was low, the counts in these categories were (9,
44, 13, 10); when family income was middle, the counts were (11, 52, 23, 22);
when family income was high, the counts were (9, 41, 12, 27).'''

shows that the true odds ratio with a 0.5 addition to each cell is equal to ~0.79.
These results (odds being <1) suggest that a black defendant is more likely to get a death 
sentence than a white defendent regardless of the victims race.

The marginal odds ratio suggests that a white defendent is 1.18 more likely to get the death penalty.
Because the marginal and conditional tables give us conflicting results, these data clearly 
give an example of Simpsons Paradox.'
  
  
  
  
  
###2.36
An example of this situation and Simpsons Paradox can be observed when considering
COVID-19 CFR rates of China and Italy from the beginning stages of the pandemic.
A break down of decadal age groups amongst Italians suggests that individual age groups
are more likely to survive a COVID19 infection than Chinese citizens. However,
an overall analysis of CFR would show that Chinese COVID positive patients are more
likely to survive than Italians. This phenomenom is due to the fact that of age
demographics between the two populations. Though having a much larger population, 
the Chinese are generally much younger than Italians. This paradox occurend 
because COVID-19 is much more deadly to elderly people (~ <60 i.e., Italians) 
than younger people. It is highly conceivable that similar comparible situations 
are occuring in various other communities.
