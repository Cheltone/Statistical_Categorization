## 4.12
a)

```{r}
def_est = -0.8678
vic_est = 2.4044
```

The coefficients in these results suggest that a black defendent in a homicide where the victim is white is more likely to receive the death penalty.



Probabilities
```{r}
WProb = (exp(vic_est+((0.6006*11))))/(1+exp(vic_est+(0.6006*11)))
WProb
```

The probability is 0.999878.

```{r}
BProb = (exp(def_est+((0))))/(1+exp(def_est+(0)))
BProb
```
The probability is 0.2957123.

b)
```{r}
vrace = exp(vic_est)
vrace
```

This result suggests that when a black defendeng receives the death penalty that the odds of the victim being white is 11.07189.

c) 

```{r}
CILow = exp(1.3068)
CIHigh = exp(3.7175)

CILow
CIHigh
```
The 95% CI is (3.694, 41.161)

d)
```{r}
WT = (2.4044/0.6006)**2
WT
```
The results of the Wald Test suggest enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The variables are not independent.

## 4.16


```{r}
drink = read.csv("C:\\Users\\chadm\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Fall_2020\\STATS 578\\HW\\HW4\\Ex4.16.csv",header=TRUE)


drink.fit <- glm(cbind(Yes,No)~tf+jp+EI+SN,data=drink, family = binomial())
summary(drink.fit)
```
The equation would be -2.1140+0.6873TF + 0.2022JP - 0.5550EI -0.4292SN

b) 


```{r}
ESTJ = -2.1140 + 0.6873*(1) + 0.2022*(0) - 0.5550*(0) -0.4292
piHat = exp(ESTJ)/(1+exp(ESTJ))
piHat
```
The estimated value of piHat for a personality type ESTJ equals 0.1351817

c) 

```
ENTP = -2.1140 + 0.6873*(1) + 0.2022*(1) - 0.5550*(0) -0.42920*(0) 
ENTP
piHatc = exp(ENTP)/(1+exp(ENTP))
piHatc
```

Here, ENTP will have the highest (piHat =  0.2271455) because the negative coefficients are not included in the calculation.

## 4.16
a)

```{r}
piHatInt = exp(-2.8291)/(1+exp(-2.8291))
piHatInt
```
PiHat for someone who is introverted and feeling is 0.05577177.

b)
```{r}
EIOddsRat = exp(0.5805)
EIOddsRat
```
Here, an extrovert is 1.79 more likely to drinking frequently than an introvert.

c) 
```{r}
confint(drink417.fit)
CILo = exp(0.1589)
CIHi = exp(1.008)
CILo
CIHi
```

The confidence interval is (1.1722,2.7401).

d)

```{r}
ICoef = 1/1.79
ICoef

ICIHi = 1/exp(CILo)
ICILo = 1/exp(CIHi)

ICILo
ICIHi
```

e)

The likelihood ratio test provided a chisq value of 7.28, which translates into a p-Value of 0.0070. These results are significant and therefore
we reject the null hypothesis.
